This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

About the Movie Website Project
Welcome, to the best movie website using react js tutorial. In this react js movie website series, we will cover many important topics which will surely help you to secure a react js job with any company.

We will see how to call an API, and how to display API data using the map on our page, they will use the context API and useContext hook to store the data and then pass it to the children who need it.

We have a search input form too, where users can search any movie name, and based on that query we show them the results the best part is we use debounce on our website, which helps API to hit once only when it is required to know more about the debounce, I highly recommend you to watch the video.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
